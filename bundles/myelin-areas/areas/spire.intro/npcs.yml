  description: "This automaton has a glyph on it that reads 'CRAWLER'. It is something akin to a six-'legged' spider, with two 'arms' consisting of a blowtorch and a grappling clas. On top of the middle of its torso is a dome, filled with an iridescent fluid and chunks of grey matter. Steam billows from the many gaskets lining its underbelly like metallic ribs."
