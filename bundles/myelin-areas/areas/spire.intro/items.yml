          The voice begins, 'The Spire was created after the truce between the Shonn√≠ and the Anzeige Empire...' A time-lapse animation of the Spire being raised is projected from the crystal, starting with mountain-sized machines flattening the earth, and ending with flying automatons hauling chunks of the structure's massive carapace to its very top.

          'Declaring themselves the bastion of civilization, the peoples conspired to transcend the rest of humanity by taking on projects previously thought to be impossible...' A series of glyphs appear above the crystal, and the voice echoes in your head in a monotone chant:

          An image of the person's face, in one of the cryo-cylinders, flashes before you.
          The green eyes open, a look of shock on their face...
        On Project Sacredname: |
          ...A man and a woman are in an otherwise empty room, sitting cross-legged, deep in thought.
          They both mouth a word at the same time, shimmer, and vanish...

        On The Automaton Uprising: |
          A man's voice begins, in a hurried and breathless tone:
          'I hope this can save someone's life. It's too late for me.

          Something has happened to the automatons here in the spire. It started this morning when a
          few experiments were ruined by what seemed to be a routine malfunction.

          Midday, there was an announcement: We were to decommission any automatons behaving abnormally.

          Rumors began to spread. Regardless of the cause, some of the automatons had learned to betray a root-level directive, the command to do no harm. This aberration seemed to spread like a virus and within the last few minutes, it reached our floor. A battle erupted and *the voice chokes up for a minute* we lost. We were overwhelmed, even with the handful of security drones that were still on our side.

          I am bleeding far too much to be able to escape. *the voice laughs mirthlessly*

          My last acts are to record this message, and to enable a security fence that will hopefully prevent the automatons from slaughtering anyone unlucky enough to be revived on this floor.

          If you're listening to this, they should be confined to the north end of the floor. Be careful.'

          The message ends with a short burst of static.
